### ðŸ¥… Testing Aims

The testing aims of this project are...

* [ ] To have an up to date project board
* [ ] To have high quality user stories and test cases
* [ ] To have very clear Gherkin scenarios derived from user stories represent the user journeys
* [ ] To have a fully functional test framework using POM pattern
* [ ] Well documented defect reports
* [ ] Exploratory Test Charters
* [ ] GitHub Action Workflows

### ðŸ’» Installation/Running Test/Visual Helpers?

YouTube video show how to run the tests/use CLI to run tests/generate report etc.?

### ðŸ’­ Definitions of Done and Ready

**Definition of Done for Web Testing For Luma...**

* Thorough test coverage
* Repeatable tests
* Isolated tests that test single unit
* Easily readable tests - even non-technical can understand them.
* All high and medium priority User Stories are covered by 10 tests (with passing rate of X%)
* All high and medium defects have Defect Reports written.

**Definition of Done for Presentation...**

* Slides are well designed, with concise, accurate information
* Presenters know their slides well enough to discuss them without a script
* Multimedia such as living documentation, videos and graphs are used
* Use of text is minimal
* Retrospective has been completed and findings are present within slides.

**Definition of Ready...**
To be ready for testing, Usr Stories must be:

* Immediately actionable
* Negotiated and agreed upon by all
* Valuable User Stories i.e. Users paths with most coverage or business value are given priority
* Estimatable i.e. expected response can be estimated
* Small
* Testable

And the project must have:

* Individual test cases written
* A ready-to-use Testing Framework
